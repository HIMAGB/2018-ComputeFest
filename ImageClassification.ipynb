    "### 1.1 - From Linear to Deep Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Beyond Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models can be fit efficiently via convex optimization, but the model capacity is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative:\n",
    "$$ f(x) = w^T\\phi(x) $$\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is a *non-linear transform*\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine-learning model transforms its input data into meaningful outputs, a process that is “learned” from exposure to known examples of inputs and outputs. Therefore, the central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully transform data: in other words, to learn useful *representations* of the input data at hand—representations that get us closer to the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to use a very generic $\\phi$. If $\\phi(x)$ is of high enough dimension, we can always have enough capacity to fit the training set, but generalization to the test set often remains poor. Very generic feature mappings are usually based only on the principle of local smoothness and do not encode enough prior information to solve advanced problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to manually engineer $\\phi$. Until the advent of deep learning, this was the dominant approach. It requires decades of human eﬀort foreach separate task, with practitioners specializing in different domains, such as speech recognition or computer vision, and with little transfer between domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly learn $\\phi$ with parameters $\\theta$, specifically:\n",
    "$$f(x;\\theta) = w^T\\phi(x;\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have parameters $\\theta$ that we use to learn $\\phi$ from a broad class of functions, and parameters that map from $\\phi(x)$ to the desired output. This is an example of a deep feed-forward network, with $\\phi$ deﬁning a hidden layer. This approach is the only one of the three that gives up on the convexity of the training problem, but the beneﬁts outweigh the harms. In this approach, we parametrize the representation as $\\phi(x;\\theta)$ and use the optimization algorithm to ﬁnd the $\\theta$ that corresponds to a good representation. If we wish, this approach can capture the beneﬁt of the first approach by being highly generic—we do so by using a very broad family $\\phi(x;\\theta)$. Deep learning can also capture the beneﬁt of the second approach. Human practitioners can encode their knowledge to help generalization by designing families $\\phi(x;\\theta)$ that they expect will perform well. The advantage is that the human designer only needs to ﬁnd the right general function family rather than ﬁnding precisely the right function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![layers of representations](representations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *deep* in *deep learning* isn’t a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach; rather, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the *depth* of the model. Other appropriate names for the field could have been *layered representations learning* and *hierarchical representations learning*. Modern deep learning often involves tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations— and they’re all learned automatically from exposure to training data.\n"

    "* Examples of the expected **output** —In a speech-recognition task, these could be human-generated transcripts of sound files. In an image task, expected outputs could be tags such as “dog,” “cat,” and so on.\n",
    "* A **cost (or loss) function** which is a way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job. This is necessary in order to determine the distance between the algorithm’s current output and its expected output. The measurement is used as a feedback signal to adjust the way the algorithm works. This adjustment step is what we call *learning*.\n",

    "The MNIST example is a category of machine learning called *supervised learning*. This is by far the most common case. It consists of learning to map input data to known targets (also called *annotations*), given a set of examples (often annotated by humans).  Generally, almost all applications of deep learning that are in the spotlight these days belong in this category, such as optical character recognition, speech recognition, image classification, and language translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluating machine-learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MNIST example, we split the data into a training set and a test set. The reason not to evaluate the models on the same data they were trained on quickly became evident: after just a few epochs, all the model began to *overfit*. That is, their performance on never-before-seen data started stalling (or worsening) compared to their performance on the training data—which always improves as training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the goal is to achieve models that *generalize*—that perform well on never-before-seen data—and overfitting is the central obstacle. You can only control that which you can observe, so it’s crucial to be able to reliably measure the generalization power of your model. The following sections look at strategies for mitigating overfitting and maximizing generalization. In this section, we’ll focus on how to measure generalization: how to evaluate machine-learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, you’ll end up with a model that performs artificially well on the training data, because that’s what you optimized it for. You care about performance on completely new data, not the training data, so you need to use a completely different, never-before-seen dataset to evaluate the model: the test dataset. Your model shouldn’t have had access to any information about the test set, even indirectly. If anything about the model has been tuned based on test set performance, then your measure of generalization will be flawed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting your data into training and test sets may seem straightforward, but there are a few advanced ways to do it that can come in handy when little data is available. Let’s review three classic evaluation recipes: simple hold-out validation, K-fold validation, and iterated K-fold validation with shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Hold-out Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we did with the MNIST data. Set apart some fraction of your data as your test set. Train on the remaining data, and evaluate on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "![hold out validation](holdout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest evaluation protocol, and it suffers from one flaw: if little data is available, then your training and test sets may contain too few samples to be statistically representative of the data at hand. This is easy to recognize: if different random shuffling rounds of the data before splitting end up yielding very different measures of model performance, then you’re having this issue. K-fold validation and iterated K-fold validation are two ways to address this, as discussed next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-fold Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, you split your data into $K$ partitions of equal size. For each partition `i`, train a model on the remaining $K – 1$ partitions, and evaluate it on partition `i`. Your final score is then the averages of the $K$ scores obtained. This method is helpful when the performance of your model shows significant variance based on your train-test split. Like hold-out validation, this method doesn’t exempt you from using a distinct validation set for model calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "![K-fold validation](kfold.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterated K-Fold Validation with Shuffling\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is for situations in which you have relatively little data available and you need to evaluate your model as precisely as possible. This can be helpful in Kaggle competitions. It consists of applying K-fold validation multiple times, shuffling the data every time before splitting it $K$ ways. The final score is the average of the scores obtained at each run of K-fold validation. Note that you end up training and evaluating $P \\times K$ models (where $P$ is the number of iterations you use), which can very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MNIST case, the performance of the model on the held-out validation data always peaked after a few epochs and then began to degrade: the model quickly started to overfit to the training data. Overfitting happens in every machine-learning problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.\n",
    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. *Optimization* refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the *learning* in *machine learning*), whereas *generalization* refers to how well the trained model performs on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of course, but you don’t control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
    "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower the loss on training data, the lower the loss on test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be *underfit*: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn’t yet modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops improving, and validation metrics stall and then begin to degrade: the model is starting to overfit. That is, it’s beginning to learn patterns that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n",
    "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, *the best solution is to get more training data*. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that isn’t possible, the next-best solution is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store or to add constraints on what information it’s allowed to store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",
    "The processing of fighting overfitting this way is called *regularization*. "
